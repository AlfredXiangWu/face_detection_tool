# face detection tool
Face detection tool is a program for analyzing and evaluating the face detection results.

To do:
~~1. Read image list and show image~~
2. Draw the ground truth
~~Draw rectangle bounding box (AFW)~~
Draw ellipse bounding box (FDDB)
~~3. Show face detection results~~
4. Check detection results (true positive detection or false positive detection) for each image
5. Compute precision and recall for dataset
6. print error log (the image which contains too many false positive detection results)
