# face detection tool
Face detection tool is a program for analyzing and evaluating the face detection results.<br>

To do:<br>
~~1. Read image list and show image~~<br>
~~2. Draw the ground truth~~<br>
* ~~Draw rectangle bounding box (AFW)~~<br>
* ~~Draw ellipse bounding box (FDDB)~~<br>

~~3. Show face detection results~~<br>
4. Check detection results (true positive detection or false positive detection) for each image<br>
5. Compute precision and recall for dataset<br>
6. print error log (the image which contains too many false positive detection results)<br>
